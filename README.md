This application is simulating a web application to purchase tickets.

It uses different forms of input, text input fields, drop down menu and buttons,
to register which movie you want to buy tickets for, how many, and personal details about the purchaser.

The bulk of the javascript deals with input validation. Here it is checked that something has been entered into the fields. 
And it checks that it is of the correct format, either a string or a number. It also ensures that phone numbers contain exactly 
8 characters, and that emails are in a valid format. If any of the checks fails an appropriate error message is displayed. 

If all the input validation goes trough the application then creates an object with all the information, and stores this object in an 
array. It also prints everything in said array using a for loop and html table syntax. Lastly there is a button that empties the whole 
array if pressed. 

My final remark is that the application seems a bit language confused with a mix of Norwegian and English. This is due to my own confusion 
about the task being described in Norwegian, and the lectures being held in English. I apologize for the inconvenience.
